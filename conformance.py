Livetools design system conformance checker.

Point it at a file or a directory and it reports anything that has drifted off
the system. Exit code 1 on any error, so it can gate a commit or a CI step.

WHY THIS EXISTS
A design system that relies on people remembering it decays. Worse, an AI coding
agent asked to "make the button red" will happily write #ED1C24 into a component,
and the result looks correct in the moment and is wrong forever. Documentation
does not catch that. This does.

The rules below are the ones that actually got broken during this build, not a
generic lint list:

  raw-hex          a colour written as a literal instead of a token. This is the
                   big one. Every hex outside the token file is a colour that
                   will not follow the theme, will not follow the scheme, and
                   will not be caught by the contrast checks.
  raw-font-size    a px or pt font size instead of a --lt-text-* token, which
                   breaks the density modes and ignores the user's browser
                   setting.
  inline-style-state
                   an inline style on an interactive element. Inline styles carry
                   no :hover, :focus or :active, so a control styled this way
                   looks fine and is dead. This is exactly how a Cancel button
                   shipped without a hover state.
  page-surface-in-field
                   an input reading --lt-surface-page. Fields must read the field
                   tokens or they invert against their own card when the colour
                   scheme flips.
  icon-button-unnamed
                   an icon-only button with no accessible name. A screen reader
                   announces it as "button" and nothing else.
  unlabelled-input
                   an input with no label, aria-label or aria-labelledby.
  undefined-element
                   an lt- custom element used in markup but never registered,
                   which renders as an inert unknown element.
  brand-red-small-text
                   var(--lt-brand-red) used as a text or fill colour without the
                   large-text sizing that makes it pass AA at 4.38:1.

The icon rules (added 2026-07-28, see ICONS-PROPOSAL.md). The Evolute
pictogram review found 18 icons carrying 7 raw hexes behind a green
conformance run, because an SVG presentation attribute is neither a <style>
block nor a style= attribute, so css_regions() never saw it. These rules
close that route and enforce the icon standard decided the same day:

  icon-raw-colour  a fill= or stroke= attribute holding a literal colour.
                   The exact way an agent writes an inline SVG, and the
                   demonstrated hole: fill="#A66B1F" and fill="steelblue"
                   both passed before this rule existed.
  icon-grid        a viewBox that is not one of the two tiers, 0 0 24 24
                   (renders 16-24px) or 0 0 48 48 (renders 32-48px). Any
                   other grid renders strokes at broken widths: the 44-grid
                   Evolute set drew a "2px" stroke at 1.09px in its own
                   tables. data-lt-decorative exempts a non-icon graphic.
  icon-opacity     opacity inside icon markup. A translucent fill has no
                   value until composited, composites differently on every
                   surface, cannot be contrast-checked, and is discarded by
                   forced colours. The Evolute engagement tints measured
                   1.17-1.38:1 against their own backdrops.
  icon-raw-size    an icon sized with literal px instead of --lt-icon-size /
                   --lt-pictogram-size, which opts it out of density.
  icon-unnamed     an inline <svg> neither declared decorative (aria-hidden)
                   nor named (aria-label, aria-labelledby, or a <title>).

The token-graph rules (added 2026-07-28, prompted by the first consumer
report, Evolute tool-manager). The defects that report chased are ABSENCE
bugs: nothing wrong is written, something necessary is missing, and every
rule above looks for a wrong value present. These three look at the whole
checked set at once. An unresolvable var() does not error; the declaration
is invalid at computed-value time and the property silently takes its
initial value, which is why this class of bug reaches a rendered page:

  undefined-token  a var(--lt-*) with no fallback that nothing in the
                   checked set defines. A typo (--lt-space-04) or a token
                   dropped by a version bump computes to nothing, silently.
  conditional-token-no-fallback
                   a var(--lt-*) with no fallback whose definitions ALL sit
                   inside conditional contexts: an @media / @supports /
                   @container block, or a selector that only matches when an
                   attribute is present. If the condition does not hold, the
                   token does not exist. Two classification subtleties are
                   load-bearing, and the consumer report's own hand analysis
                   got both backwards, which is the best argument for the
                   rule being machine-run: a selector LIST is unconditional
                   if ANY alternative is bare :root or html (so
                   ":root, [data-lt-density=comfortable]" IS a root
                   default), and a bare :root INSIDE @media is still
                   conditional (so the pointer-coarse block is not).
  token-self-cycle a custom property whose value references itself, e.g.
                   --x: max(var(--x), 44px). That is a cycle (CSS Variables
                   §3.4) and computes to guaranteed-invalid on EVERY
                   element; an inherited value does not break it. Exactly
                   this pattern sat in the token file's pointer-coarse
                   block and invalidated --lt-control-height on all touch
                   hardware, measured 2026-07-28. Checked in every file
                   including lt-tokens.css: the raw-hex exemption is about
                   literal colours being that file's job, and a cycle is
                   never anyone's job.
